            Being a self learner myself I have realised that although learning
            by yourself without a mentor/guide is great fun as well as an
            immense learning , but it also frustartes you and sometimes (almost
            everytime) it costs you a alot of time to be devoted for a small
            problem. Lack of guidence and help sometimes escapes a opportunity
            for you
